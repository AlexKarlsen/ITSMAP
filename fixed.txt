App won't start and neither compile:
The app crashed due to the database being empty when the app installs. 
Fixed: We have inserted a null check and the app now installs and runs without problems.

Missing resource externalisation:
Ignored: We have externalised resources. What you can see in the XML files is simply design placeholders. 
The tag such as "sunny", "rainy" etc. is set from the code. 
The placeholders in the XML will never be visible to the user.

Missing weather pics:
Ignored: It is not required to have pictures representing the current weather.
